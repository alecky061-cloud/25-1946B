  <h1>Electronic Gaming Hub</h1>
  <p>
    An Electronic Gaming Hub is a centralized platform that unites game libraries,
    community features, streaming access, and events into one ecosystem. It allows
    players to manage their collections, connect socially, and discover new titles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hubs often include cloud gaming, tournaments, and creator tools for mods and
    content sharing. They represent the future of digital play by merging
    entertainment, social interaction, and technology.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond entertainment, gaming hubs foster creativity, provide comfort during
    difficult times, and create a sense of community. They are more than just
    platforms — they are cultural spaces where people connect and grow.
